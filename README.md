Neonite++ is a fully rewritten version of the old project [neoniteV2](https://github.com/NeoniteDev/neonitev2), but this time it's a launcher, a server within the launcher and a cool dll that adds some magic touches to your game client


This project is in an early development phase (About 60% done),

(Consider that it's one of my very first c++ projects so it may contain a lot of bad code, have mercy please.)
